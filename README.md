## Background and situationship

**Find a background and situation in my last post in Medium. It is really interesting how fast-refresh has evolved during the years.** Visit my [blog entry](https://medium.com/@imgeorgemor/if-you-know-what-fast-refresh-is-this-is-for-you-otherwise-keep-scrolling-b5dba86d2f48) where I go from the begining of hot reload to the current fast refresh.

## Features

- React 18
- React Fast Refresh
- Webpack 5
- Typescript support (check Typescript branch)
- Node env supported
- basic eslint configuration for react (also with typescript support)
